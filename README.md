# Goals App inspired by the React-Native Course by Academind aka Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller (Udemy Course)

## Goals App

**This project uses the following:**

   - React components and building UIs
   - Styling React Native Apps
   - Managing State

### The GoalInput File Explanation

- **The functions and useState Hooks were brought here because the state of the input is managed here.** The state of the input is the text that is entered into the TextInput. The state of the input is then passed to the App.js component via the addGoal prop. The addGoal prop is then passed to the GoalInput component in App.js. The addGoal prop is then called in the GoalInput component and the state of the input is passed to the addGoal prop. The state of the input is then passed to the addGoalHandler function in App.js. The state of the input is then passed to the setCourseGoals function in App.js. The state of the input is then passed to the courseGoals state in App.js. The state of the input is then passed to the FlatList component in App.js. The state of the input is then passed to the GoalItem component in App.js. The state of the input is then passed to the GoalText component in GoalItem.js. The state of the input is then displayed in the GoalText component in GoalItem.js.
